git init ----> initializes the repository
git add . ----> commits all the changed files 
git status ----> shows the status of the repository
git commit -m "first commit" ----> saving the first instance

green colour in status shows the file is added but not commited
red colour shows the latest file hasnt been added to the staging area
if status is empty then all the files in the repository are saved

we need to add the files after every change. so if we add the file and then provide changes then the commit will only store the file previous to the change
